    stores. http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/changeset/8748
  * Adjustments in text store for better encapsulation.
  * Test cleanups to increase coverage and make it easier
    to test other stores with existing tests.

    under mod_python.

0.9.11 Wed Feb  4 20:40:47 GMT 2009

  * Fairly critical performance fix when loading large TiddlyWikis.
  * Change the twanager server command and tiddlyweb.config so
    it is possible to run just 'twanager server' and get some
    reasonable defaults.

0.9.10 Wed Feb  4 13:36:03 GMT 2009

  * When creating an instance, establish a unique MAC secret.

  ** Add server.title attribute to wiki serialization of 
     tiddlers to support client side renaming.
  ** Add Etag handling when POST to revisions collection.
  ** Add optional Etag handling when DELETE a tiddler.
  * Use html5lib to parse tiddly content (into a 
    BeautifulSoup tree).

0.9.8 Thu Jan 22 17:07:34 GMT 2009

  * Make sure that we enforce the use of an older BeautifulSoup
    to avoid errors while parsing TiddlyWiki files
  * urllib.quote escapes () but javascript encodeURIComponent does
    not, leading to Etag comparison errors. Fixed.
  * If the tiddlyweb.usersign is GUEST accept modifier value
    in PUT Tiddlers.
  * Add some code that shows how to use mod_wsgi to mount TiddlyWeb.

0.9.7 Tue Jan 20 15:59:01 GMT 2009

    when external plugins are used.
  * No longer Set-Cookie with chkHttpReadOnly set to false,
    ServerSideSavingPlugin now does this.
  * No longer have a server failure when trying to use a sort
    filter on an attribute that does not exist. Instead send
    and HTTP 400.

    serialization.
  * Correct a minor error in twanager that could cause a warning.

0.9.3 Wed Dec  3 20:05:03 GMT 2008

  * Increase the granularity of modified timestamps on
    tiddlers, so Etag generation on lists of tiddlers
    is based on seconds rather than minutes, avoiding
    some (but not all) caching problems.

0.9.2 Tue Dec  2 19:56:53 GMT 2008

  * Use sha instead of crypt for storing user passwords
    so we are more compatible across multiple systems.
