class Tiddler(object):
    """
    The primary content object in the TiddlyWiki universe, vaguely
    corresponding to a Page in other wiki systems. A Tiddler has
    text and some associated metadata. The text can be anything, but
    is usually wikitext in some form, or Javascript code to be used
    as a plugin. It is possible for a Tiddler to container binary
    content, such as image data.

    A Tiddler is intentionally just a container of data. That is, it has
    no methods which change the state of attributes in the Tiddler or
    manipulate the tiddler. Changing the attributes is done by directly
    changing the attributes. This is done to make the Tiddler easier to
    store and serialize in many ways.

    A Tiddler has several attributes:

    title: The name of the tiddler. Required.
    created: A string representing when this tiddler was
            created.
    modified: A string representing when this tiddler was
             last changed. Defaults to now.
    modifier: A string representing a personage that changed
              this tiddler in some way. This doesn't necessarily
              have any assocation with the tiddlyweb.usersign,
              though it may.
    tags: A list of strings that describe the tiddler.
    fields: An arbitrary dictionary of extended (custom) fields on the tiddler.
    text: The contents of the tiddler. A string.
    revision: The revision of this tiddler. An int.
    bag: The name of the bag in which this tiddler exists,
         if any. Usually set by internal code.
    recipe: The name of the recipe in which this tiddler exists,
            if any. Usually set by internal code.
    store: A reference to the Store object which retrieved
           this tiddler from persistent storage.
