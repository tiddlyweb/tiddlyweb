# This file is the URL map for TiddlyWeb. URL paths
# dispatch, by REQUEST_METHOD, to WSGI style callables
# in the tiddlyweb.web.handler package in the TiddlyWeb code. 
#
# The map is automatically loaded at run time and 
# processed by Selector. Fields within { } are
# made available in the WSGI environment.
#
# You may extend TiddlyWeb by adding URLs in this
# file and pointing to WSGI applications of your
# own design. It is important to remember that
# these applications will be running withing the
# TiddlyWeb stack, listed as 'server_request_filters' and
# 'server_response_filters' in tiddlyweb.config.
# These provide authentication handling, database
# setup, UTF-8 encoding and associated functionality.
#
# Below each URL is listed, followed by HTTP methods
# and pointers to the methods which handle the request.
# The default content types available for the request
# are listed as well. Some TiddlyWeb installations will
# have more or less content types depending on configuration.
#
# If a URL as a .format extension, this is a method by
# which it is possible to request a different content-type
# for the requested resource, overriding the Accept header.
# See tiddlyweb.config for supported extensions.
#
# URLs that produce collections of Tiddlers accept a
# filter query_string to filter the results.
